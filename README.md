## ‚úÖ Deliverables

-   The project consists of three modular REST apps: User, Vehicles, Booking.
-   All apps use APIViews from Django Rest Framework including builtin APIs with mixins and generics.
-   The project uses Django provided JWT Authentication which is required for all API calls except for User and Token creation and Swagger documentation.
-   All application calls can only be accessed with an authorization token.
-   Request data is serialized and validated with REST serializers, including custom validators and provides clear error message in case of request failure.
-   The project handles all errors gracefully, only providing error details if DEBUG is set to False in the .env file.
-   API Documentation is provided through the **/swagger** endpoint.
-   Unit tests are added to each module to test the happy flow and edge cases.
-   The project has been uploaded as a public GitHub repository with a detailed **README.md**.

---

## ‚úÖ Assumptions

-   The project was built with Python 3.12.2.
-   The backend uses **SQLite** for quick development; switch to PostgreSQL for production.
-   **Stripe payments** are mocked with a placeholder ‚Äî no real payment processing.
-   No overlapping bookings are allowed for the same vehicle.
-   Only **authenticated users** can manage their own cars/bookings.
-   JWT secret and expiry settings should be configured securely in `settings.py` before deploying.
